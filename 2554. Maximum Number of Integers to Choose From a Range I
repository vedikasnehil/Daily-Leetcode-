2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I

You are given an integer array banned and two integers n and maxSum.
You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

The chosen integers have to be in the range [1, n].
Each integer can be chosen at most once.
The chosen integers should not be in the array banned.
The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed maxSum.

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def maxCount(self, banned, n, maxSum):
        banned = set(banned)
        res, sum_, curr = 0, 0, 1
        while curr <= n:
            if curr not in banned:
                if sum_ + curr <= maxSum:
                    res += 1
                    sum_ += curr
                else: break
            curr += 1
        return res

Input
banned =[1,6,5]
n =5
maxSum =6
Output
2
