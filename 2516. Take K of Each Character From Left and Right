2516. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right

You are given a string s consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and a non-negative integer k.
Each minute, you may take either the leftmost character of s, or the rightmost character of s.

Return the minimum number of minutes needed for you to take at least k of each character, 
or return -1 if it is not possible to take k of each character.

Solution-

class Solution:
    def takeCharacters(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        # Total counts
        count = [0, 0, 0]
        for c in s:
            count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1

        if min(count) < k:
            return -1

        # Sliding Window
        res = float("inf")
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[ord(s[r]) - ord('a')] -= 1

            while min(count) < k:
                count[ord(s[l]) - ord('a')] += 1
                l += 1
            res = min(res, len(s) - (r - l + 1))
        return res

Output-
