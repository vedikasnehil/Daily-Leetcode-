916. Word Subsets

You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.

For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

class Solution:
    def wordSubsets(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        from collections import Counter
        
        req = Counter()
        for word in words2:
            cur = Counter(word)
            for ch in cur:
                req[ch] = max(req[ch], cur[ch])
        
        ans = []
        for word in words1:
            cur = Counter(word)
            if all(cur[ch] >= req[ch] for ch in req):
                ans.append(word)
        
        return ans

Input
words1 =["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"]
words2 =["e","o"]
Output
["facebook","google","leetcode"]
