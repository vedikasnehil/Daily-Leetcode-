2337. Move Pieces to Obtain a String

You are given two strings start and target, both of length n. 
Each string consists only of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' where:

The characters 'L' and 'R' represent pieces, where a piece 'L' can move 
to the left only if there is a blank space directly to its left, and a piece
'R' can move to the right only if there is a blank space directly to its right.
The character '_' represents a blank space that can be occupied by any of the 'L' or 'R' pieces.

Solution:-
class Solution:
    def canChange(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        n=len(s)
        s+='@'
        t+='@'
        i, j=0, 0
        while i<n or j<n:
            while i<n and s[i]=='_': i+=1
            while j<n and t[j]=='_': j+=1
            c=s[i]
            if c!=t[j]: return False
            if c=='L' and i<j: return False
            if c=='R' and i>j: return False
            i+=1
            j+=1
        return True
        

Input
start ="_L__R__R_"
target ="L______RR"
Output
true
